## Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Understanding the genetic factors contributing to this disease can lead to better diagnosis and treatment strategies. This project aims to analyze gene expression data to identify differentially expressed genes in AD patients compared to control individuals.

## Data Preparation

The dataset used for this analysis includes gene expression levels for various genes under two conditions: Alzheimer’s disease and control. The data has been preprocessed to ensure quality and reliability.

## Methodology

1. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - A t-test is performed to compare gene expression levels between AD and control samples.
   - Fold change is calculated to quantify the magnitude of differences.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Volcano plots are generated to visualize the significance of differential expression.
   - Boxplots are created to show the distribution of gene expression levels across conditions.

## Results

The analysis identifies several genes that are significantly differentially expressed in Alzheimer’s disease, along with their respective p-values and fold changes. The volcano plots and boxplots provide visual insights into the expression patterns.

## Discussion

The results highlight the potential genetic factors involved in Alzheimer’s disease and suggest avenues for further research. Future studies could explore the functional implications of the identified genes and their roles in disease progression.

## Conclusion

This analysis enhances our understanding of the genetic basis of Alzheimer’s disease and serves as a foundation for future investigations into its molecular mechanisms.
